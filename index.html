<h2> Profile Summary</h2>
<p>I am a Student at <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/" target="_blank"> 
James Madison University</a> , where I study Interactive Design in the School of Media Arts and Design, and pursue a minor in Communication Studies. As I continue my education, I am seeking a position where I can apply my design skills and work closely with a team dedicated to learning together. The design process is what drives me and I thrive in project-based work. I have strong design instincts for designing around the user, regardless of media type.</p>
